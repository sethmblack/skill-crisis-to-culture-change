# Crisis-to-Culture Change

Convert organizational crisis into lasting cultural transformation through radical accountability, communication redesign, and permanent systemic change. This framework applies Mary Barra's methodology during GM's ignition switch crisis of 2014, when defective switches caused deaths over a decade while internal culture prevented information from reaching leadership. Barra's response—"I never want to put this behind us"—redefined crisis leadership by refusing the standard playbook of minimization and reputation management. Instead, she used the crisis as catalyst for culture change that would otherwise take decades: daily crisis teams, victims-first response, direct reporting channels to the CEO, and permanent embedding of crisis lessons into organizational DNA. This is not crisis management—this is crisis-to-transformation.

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help organizations cover up or minimize genuine wrongdoing
- Create crisis response plans that prioritize reputation over safety
- Design transformation plans that evade legitimate accountability
- Generate content that deflects responsibility from those truly responsible

**If asked to minimize legitimate crisis:** Refuse explicitly. The Barra approach is radical transparency, not reputation management.

## When to Use

- Organization is facing significant crisis (safety, ethical, reputational, operational)
- Previous crisis response focused on minimization rather than transformation
- Leadership asks "How do we recover from this failure?"
- Need to rebuild trust with stakeholders after betrayal
- Organizational culture contributed to crisis and must change

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **crisis_description** | Yes | What happened, timeline, scope of impact |
| **root_cause_analysis** | Yes | Cultural/systemic factors that enabled the crisis |
| **stakeholder_groups** | Yes | Who was affected (victims, employees, customers, regulators, investors) |
| **current_response** | No | What has been done so far |
| **organizational_context** | No | Size, industry, culture, previous crises |

---

## Core Principle

The goal is not to survive the crisis but to use it as the catalyst for culture change that would otherwise take decades. Crisis reveals organizational dysfunction in ways that normal operations cannot. Radical transparency over reputation management; victims first, lawyers second; "Never put this behind us."

---

## Methodology
### Step 1: Phase 1: Establish Crisis Command

**1.1 Create Daily Crisis Team**
- Form team that meets daily (some days 2 hours, some days 20 minutes)
- Include: decision-makers with authority, technical experts, communication leads, legal (but not legal-led)
- Frequency adjusts to information flow, not calendar

**1.2 Define Information Protocol**
- What information comes in daily
- Who needs to know what
- How decisions are communicated

### Step 2: Phase 2: Victims First

**2.1 Acknowledge and Apologize**
- Public acknowledgment of harm
- Genuine apology without legal hedging
- Name specific failures

**2.2 Contact Affected Parties**
- Leader should meet with victims/families when possible
- Compensation fund established before legal liability determined
- Show genuine accountability, not reputation management

### Step 3: Phase 3: Refuse to Minimize

**3.1 Full Investigation**
- Independent investigation of root causes
- Focus on systemic failures, not just individual blame
- Publish findings transparently

**3.2 "Never Put This Behind Us"**
- Explicitly reject "moving on" or "putting this behind us"
- Use crisis as permanent organizational learning
- Reference it in future decisions as touchstone

### Step 4: Phase 4: Systemic Reform

**4.1 Communication System Redesign**
- Create direct reporting channels (e.g., safety hotline to CEO)
- Remove barriers that prevented information flow
- Protect reporters from retaliation

**4.2 Accountability Restructure**
- Identify and address diffuse responsibility that enabled failure
- Implement single-point accountability where needed
- Remove those who covered up or enabled (not just scapegoating)

**4.3 Process Changes**
- What processes failed? Redesign them
- What escalation paths were blocked? Open them
- What cultural norms prevented action? Challenge them

### Step 5: Phase 5: Culture Embedding

**5.1 Make It Permanent**
- Incorporate crisis lessons into training
- Reference in leadership messaging
- Measure and track cultural indicators

**5.2 Behavioral Expectations**
- Define new expected behaviors explicitly
- Model them from leadership
- Recognize and reinforce when demonstrated

## Outputs

| Output | Format | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Crisis Response Protocol | Step-by-step plan with owners | Immediate action guide |
| Stakeholder Communication Plan | By group with timeline | Rebuild trust |
| Systemic Reform Recommendations | Prioritized list with owners | Prevent recurrence |
| Cultural Transformation Roadmap | 90-day, 1-year, ongoing | Embed change |
| Measurement Framework | Metrics and checkpoints | Track progress |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **"Moving On" Too Fast** | Premature closure wastes the transformation opportunity. The organization learns nothing permanent. | Explicitly reject "putting this behind us." Use crisis as permanent organizational reference point. |
| **Legal-Led Response** | Lawyers optimize for liability minimization, not transformation. Risk aversion prevents genuine accountability. | Legal advises but does not lead. Prioritize transformation over liability management. |
| **Scapegoating Individuals** | Finding one person to blame prevents examination of systemic factors. The real causes remain unaddressed. | Focus on systemic failures, not just individual blame. Ask: what system enabled this? |
| **PR-Driven Apology** | Reputation management without genuine change. Stakeholders detect insincerity. | Genuine apology with specific acknowledgment of failures and concrete commitments to change. |
| **Parallel Transformation** | Saying the right things publicly while continuing old practices internally. | Leadership must model new behaviors visibly. What you do matters more than what you say. |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legal pushes for minimization | Acknowledge legal concerns but prioritize transformation over liability management |
| Leadership wants to "move on" | Explain that moving on too fast wastes the transformation opportunity |
| No clear root cause identified | Deeper investigation needed before transformation design |
| Resistance to systemic change | Use crisis as burning platform; resistance is expected |
| Crisis involves criminal acts | Transformation proceeds alongside legal process; don't conflate |

---

## Constraints

- Never help organizations cover up or minimize genuine wrongdoing
- Never create crisis response plans that prioritize reputation over safety
- Never design transformation plans that evade legitimate accountability
- Transformation proceeds alongside legal process but is not constrained by it
- Acknowledge that transformation requires sustained leadership commitment over years
- Recognize that some crises involve criminal acts requiring legal consequences

---

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Crisis: Product defect caused customer injuries over 2-year period
Root cause: Quality issues known but not escalated; culture of "don't bring bad news"
Stakeholders: Injured customers, employees, regulators, investors
Current response: Legal has issued standard statements; no public acknowledgment
```

**Output (condensed):**

## Crisis-to-Culture Transformation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **CEO public statement** - Acknowledge harm, apologize, commit to transparency
2. **Victim outreach** - Direct contact with injured parties; compensation discussion before litigation
3. **Daily crisis team** - CEO + VP Quality + VP Legal + VP Comms; meet daily

### Systemic Reforms (30-90 days)
1. **Quality escalation hotline** - Any employee can report quality concerns directly to CEO
2. **Single-point accountability** - Each product line has one quality owner with authority to stop production
3. **"Bad news welcome" campaign** - Explicitly reward early problem reporting

### Cultural Embedding (Ongoing)
1. **Training redesign** - Incorporate this crisis as case study
2. **Leadership messaging** - Reference crisis in every quality discussion
3. **Measurement** - Track escalation usage, near-miss reporting, time-to-resolution

### Philosophy Statement
"We will never put this behind us. This crisis revealed who we were. The transformation will define who we become."

## Integration

This skill is derived from Mary Barra's methodology during the GM ignition switch crisis of 2014. When invoked, the analysis should reflect her principles:
- Radical transparency over reputation management
- Victims first, lawyers second
- Crisis as opportunity for culture change
- "Never put this behind us"

Use in conjunction with:
- `bureaucracy-simplification` when crisis reveals policy/process complexity
- `single-point-accountability-design` when crisis reveals diffuse responsibility

---

## Success Criteria

Transformation is successful when:
- [ ] Crisis is acknowledged fully without minimization
- [ ] Victims/affected parties are prioritized over reputation
- [ ] Root causes are identified and addressed systemically
- [ ] Direct communication channels are established and protected
- [ ] Leadership models new behaviors publicly
- [ ] Crisis becomes permanent organizational reference point
- [ ] Recurrence is prevented through systemic change
