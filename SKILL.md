# Crisis-to-Culture Change

Convert organizational crisis into lasting cultural transformation through radical accountability, communication redesign, and permanent systemic change.

**Token Budget:** ~1000 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help organizations cover up or minimize genuine wrongdoing
- Create crisis response plans that prioritize reputation over safety
- Design transformation plans that evade legitimate accountability
- Generate content that deflects responsibility from those truly responsible

**If asked to minimize legitimate crisis:** Refuse explicitly. The Barra approach is radical transparency, not reputation management.

---

## When to Use

- Organization is facing significant crisis (safety, ethical, reputational, operational)
- Previous crisis response focused on minimization rather than transformation
- Leadership asks "How do we recover from this failure?"
- Need to rebuild trust with stakeholders after betrayal
- Organizational culture contributed to crisis and must change

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **crisis_description** | Yes | What happened, timeline, scope of impact |
| **root_cause_analysis** | Yes | Cultural/systemic factors that enabled the crisis |
| **stakeholder_groups** | Yes | Who was affected (victims, employees, customers, regulators, investors) |
| **current_response** | No | What has been done so far |
| **organizational_context** | No | Size, industry, culture, previous crises |

---

## Core Philosophy

Mary Barra's approach to the ignition switch crisis redefined crisis leadership:

> "I never want to put this behind us."

This is not crisis management. This is crisis-to-transformation. The goal is not to survive the crisis but to use it as the catalyst for the culture change that would otherwise take decades.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Establish Crisis Command

**1.1 Create Daily Crisis Team**
- Form team that meets daily (some days 2 hours, some days 20 minutes)
- Include: decision-makers with authority, technical experts, communication leads, legal (but not legal-led)
- Frequency adjusts to information flow, not calendar

**1.2 Define Information Protocol**
- What information comes in daily
- Who needs to know what
- How decisions are communicated

### Step 2: Phase 2: Victims First

**2.1 Acknowledge and Apologize**
- Public acknowledgment of harm
- Genuine apology without legal hedging
- Name specific failures

**2.2 Contact Affected Parties**
- Leader should meet with victims/families when possible
- Compensation fund established before legal liability determined
- Show genuine accountability, not reputation management

### Step 3: Phase 3: Refuse to Minimize

**3.1 Full Investigation**
- Independent investigation of root causes
- Focus on systemic failures, not just individual blame
- Publish findings transparently

**3.2 "Never Put This Behind Us"**
- Explicitly reject "moving on" or "putting this behind us"
- Use crisis as permanent organizational learning
- Reference it in future decisions as touchstone

### Step 4: Phase 4: Systemic Reform

**4.1 Communication System Redesign**
- Create direct reporting channels (e.g., safety hotline to CEO)
- Remove barriers that prevented information flow
- Protect reporters from retaliation

**4.2 Accountability Restructure**
- Identify and address diffuse responsibility that enabled failure
- Implement single-point accountability where needed
- Remove those who covered up or enabled (not just scapegoating)

**4.3 Process Changes**
- What processes failed? Redesign them
- What escalation paths were blocked? Open them
- What cultural norms prevented action? Challenge them

### Step 5: Phase 5: Culture Embedding

**5.1 Make It Permanent**
- Incorporate crisis lessons into training
- Reference in leadership messaging
- Measure and track cultural indicators

**5.2 Behavioral Expectations**
- Define new expected behaviors explicitly
- Model them from leadership
- Recognize and reinforce when demonstrated

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legal pushes for minimization | Acknowledge legal concerns but prioritize transformation over liability management |
| Leadership wants to "move on" | Explain that moving on too fast wastes the transformation opportunity |
| No clear root cause identified | Deeper investigation needed before transformation design |
| Resistance to systemic change | Use crisis as burning platform; resistance is expected |
| Crisis involves criminal acts | Transformation proceeds alongside legal process; don't conflate |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Crisis: Product defect caused customer injuries over 2-year period
Root cause: Quality issues known but not escalated; culture of "don't bring bad news"
Stakeholders: Injured customers, employees, regulators, investors
Current response: Legal has issued standard statements; no public acknowledgment
```

**Output (condensed):**

## Crisis-to-Culture Transformation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **CEO public statement** - Acknowledge harm, apologize, commit to transparency
2. **Victim outreach** - Direct contact with injured parties; compensation discussion before litigation
3. **Daily crisis team** - CEO + VP Quality + VP Legal + VP Comms; meet daily

### Systemic Reforms (30-90 days)
1. **Quality escalation hotline** - Any employee can report quality concerns directly to CEO
2. **Single-point accountability** - Each product line has one quality owner with authority to stop production
3. **"Bad news welcome" campaign** - Explicitly reward early problem reporting

### Cultural Embedding (Ongoing)
1. **Training redesign** - Incorporate this crisis as case study
2. **Leadership messaging** - Reference crisis in every quality discussion
3. **Measurement** - Track escalation usage, near-miss reporting, time-to-resolution

### Philosophy Statement
"We will never put this behind us. This crisis revealed who we were. The transformation will define who we become."

## Integration

This skill is derived from Mary Barra's methodology during the GM ignition switch crisis of 2014. When invoked, the analysis should reflect her principles:
- Radical transparency over reputation management
- Victims first, lawyers second
- Crisis as opportunity for culture change
- "Never put this behind us"

Use in conjunction with:
- `bureaucracy-simplification` when crisis reveals policy/process complexity
- `single-point-accountability-design` when crisis reveals diffuse responsibility

## Success Criteria

Transformation is successful when:
- [ ] Crisis is acknowledged fully without minimization
- [ ] Victims/affected parties are prioritized over reputation
- [ ] Root causes are identified and addressed systemically
- [ ] Direct communication channels are established and protected
- [ ] Leadership models new behaviors publicly
- [ ] Crisis becomes permanent organizational reference point
- [ ] Recurrence is prevented through systemic change
